# 8-Puzzle-Solver-Search
This project implements classic search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem, a well-known problem in Artificial Intelligence and state-space search. The solver supports Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search with a Manhattan distance heuristic.

The program takes an arbitrary solvable 8-puzzle configuration and computes a sequence of moves that transforms it into the goal state, while also collecting detailed performance statistics such as nodes expanded, search depth, runtime, and memory usage.
